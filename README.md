## iOS Network Testing with ILTesting

This repo contains the companion code for http://hackazach.net/dogpark


All needed libraries are included to make installation. This project serves to demonstrate network testing on iOS *only*
and is not to be taken as an example for structuring a codebase. ;)

Included libraries:
- ILTesting
- AFnetworking
- Kiwi

### Installation instructions

Clone the repo and build the test target is all that's required. Build the test target and get goin'!
- Code written on OS X 10.7.5 
- Xcode 4.5.2
- iOS 6.0

## In Parting...
The final working API client implementation which fullfills the included tests is left as an exercise to the reader.
